The SearchResults component presents search results, including location, latitude, and longitude.

export default function SearchResults({results}) {
    // ... (component code)
}


***Zips.jsx***
The Zips component displays information about zip codes.

export default function Zips({zips}) {
    // ... (component code)
}


***api.js***
